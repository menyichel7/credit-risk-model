 Credit Scoring Business Understanding

 Influence of Basel II
The Basel II Accord emphasizes the importance of risk measurement, necessitating that credit scoring models be interpretable and well-documented. This requirement ensures that financial institutions can justify their lending decisions and comply with regulatory expectations.

 Proxy Variable Necessity
Creating a proxy variable is essential due to the absence of a direct "default" label in our dataset. This proxy helps categorize customers into high-risk and low-risk segments. Failing to accurately define this proxy could lead to poor lending decisions and increased financial risk.

 Trade-offs in Model Complexity
In regulated environments, using a simple model (like Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence) offers interpretability, which is vital for compliance. In contrast, complex models (like Gradient Boosting) may provide higher accuracy but can lack transparency, making it challenging to explain the basis of lending decisions. Balancing these trade-offs is crucial for effective credit risk management.
